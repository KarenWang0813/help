We are committed to carrying out responsible and appropriate use of student personal information collected when using our services. This is reflected in our adherence to the K-12 Student Privacy Pledge (available at https://studentprivacypledge.org/privacy-pledge/).

The Student Privacy Pledge set out the key principles we will adhere to, including:
- Not to collect, maintain, use or share student personal information beyond that needed for authorised educational/school purposes, or as authorised by the parent/student.
- Not to sell student personal information.
- Not to use or disclose student information collected through an educational/school service for behavioural targeting of advertisements to students.
- Not to build a personal profile of a student other than for supporting authorised educational/school purposes or as authorised by the parent/student.
- Not to knowingly retain student personal information beyond the time period required to support the authorised educational/school purposes, or as authorised by the parent/student.

We also commit not to make material changes to this privacy policy or other privacy policies without first providing prominent notice to the account holder(s) and allowing them choices before data is used in any manner inconsistent with terms they were initially provided.

Further, we will not make material changes to other policies or practices governing the use of student personal information that are inconsistent with our contractual requirements.
#### Teacher or schools consent in lieu of a parent
Classipe collects limited personal information from students where that student’s school, district, or teacher has provided access to our service, which collects personal information solely for the use and benefit of the learning environment. Classcipe requires schools, districts, or teachers to obtain parental consent from parents.

If you are accessing Classcipe on behalf of a Class, School or District, anywhere in the world, the following provisions also apply:
- If applicable, you represent and warrant that you are solely responsible
- for complying with the Child Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requirement to secure parental consent for accessing applications which require personal information from children under 13.
- With regard to school-based activities, COPPA allows teachers and school administrators to act in the stead of parents to provide consent for the collection of personal information from children. We recommend that Schools should always notify parents about these activities.
- You may need to obtain verifiable parental consent (“Consent”) from all parents whose children will be accessing Classcipe and provide a copy to us upon our request. For more information on your obligations under COPPA, please see www.ftc.gov/privacy.
- When obtaining such consent, you undertake to provide parents with a copy of our Privacy Policy.

#### Our Policy Toward Children
If jurisdictionally applicable, we are required under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), with limited exceptions, to obtain verifiable parental consent in order to collect, use, or disclose personal information from Children. COPPA allows the Child’s School to obtain consent for the online collection of personal information from Children who are students of the School.

If a Child wants to use our Service, he/she must first obtain an Account from his/her School. Before an Account is provided to a School, we require that the School (on behalf of the Parent) (a) consent to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information of the Child, through the Service, in accordance with this Children’s Privacy Policy, and (b) agree that the Child’s online activities are subject to the Terms of Service.

As required under COPPA, we allow Parents certain choices regarding the personal information submitted by their Children Parents should make any permitted requests with the School and have the School, as the Parent’s agent, pass on those requests to Pear Deck. We may rely on the instructions that we receive from the School that we reasonably believe are given by a Child’s Parent to the School. For example, if a representative from the Child’s School contacts us and provides the Account information we request, we may assume that the person calling is acting on behalf of the Child’s Parent.

We provide Parents the following choices with respect to the collection, use, retention and disclosure of Personal Information. A Child’s registration information is always accessible to him/her. A Parent has the right to review her Child’s Personal Information, which the Parent can obtain by contacting her Child’s School. After reviewing the Child’s Personal Information, the Parent may ask us to update or delete the Child’s Personal Information by requesting such changes through the Child’s School. A Parent may prohibit us from sharing a Child’s Personal Information with a third party by requesting such prohibition through the Child’s School. Notwithstanding any such requests, we may continue to share a Child’s Personal Information with third parties for the Internal Purposes and Enforcement Purposes (each as described above).

If a Parent chooses to prohibit any future collection, use or disclosure of the Child’s Personal Information, the Parent may do so by terminating the Child’s Account through the School, and requesting the deletion of the Child’s Personal Information through the School. Upon receiving such request from the Child’s School, we will delete the Child’s Account information from our live databases and all the information and data stored for such Account. Company will not have any liability whatsoever for any termination of the Account or related deletion of the Child’s Personal Information. When we delete Personal Information, it will be deleted from our active databases but may remain in our archives.

This privacy policy covers our collection and use of your personal information. We might update our Privacy Policy from time to time, in which case we will update the link to the Privacy Policy on our website.
