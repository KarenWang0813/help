## How to buy content from Classcipe library?
### If you are under personal account, Go to library and find the content you are interested in, you might filter the content by age, subject, and other conditions. Click buy, after successfully purchase the content, it will appear on your my content page, with a name "Copy of the original content" from the library.
### If you are under school account, you have another option to visit the school resource center where the content produced by other teachers from your school are available and free to copy. The content will only show at the school resource center if the teacher uses the content to schedule a session successfully for one class of that school.
